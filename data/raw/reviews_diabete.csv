29dd6849-53e4-440b-b32d-e876f2614cdf;jbart74;5;This was really quite delicious! I had to sub Arborito rice for the Orzo as my husband needs a gluten free diet. I thought it would take to long to cook in the oven, this killing the chicken but I only needed to add five minutes and another 1/2 cup of chix stock and it was amazing. I did squeeze a couple of fresh lemon wedges over the final product with the fresh parsley and I think that upped the flavor profile in a good way. This is a great recipe and it's going into our monthly rotation, especially during the winter months in upstate NY. Thank you for posting this recipe!
29dd6849-53e4-440b-b32d-e876f2614cdf;Veronica Sirvian;5;Delicious, didn’t change anything except reducing the butter by half
29dd6849-53e4-440b-b32d-e876f2614cdf;EatingWell Member;5;This casserole is quick and simple. It is reminiscent of very chicken piccata with it brightness, plus the briny capers. The kale was a great addition. It brings lots of texture and an earthy, bitterness to balance everything out.
29dd6849-53e4-440b-b32d-e876f2614cdf;EatingWell Member;5;One-pan Chicken Piccata AND veggies and orzo are included?? Say it isn't so! I would make this again and again.

3524f8b5-6371-4c6d-ab38-ddaf0c164a10;Frank Sullivan;3;Out of curiosity, what would you do this recipe to make it easier on people who can't handle vinegar and super spicy?
30834224-7565-4f4f-bb1e-67562401f00d;EatingWell Member;4;This is a very simple and hearty vegetable soup. The orzo gives it heft enough to make it a full meal! Vegans rejoice!
30834224-7565-4f4f-bb1e-67562401f00d;EatingWell Member;4;This vegetable soup skews Italian. I appreciate that the pasta is cooked in the broth. That's one less dish to clean up!
518c1b33-a422-4a0f-a92d-44b46a3873fb;EatingWell Member;5;I love the way the maple syrup caramelizes in the oven and the tang that the balsamic vinegar brings. The fresh, floral time is so nice as well. Also, the best part is the crispy little leaves that fall off and get extra crisp and caramelized. I like to eat all those before they even hit the table.
518c1b33-a422-4a0f-a92d-44b46a3873fb;EatingWell Member;5;Theres is great caramelization on the brussels thanks to the sugar content of both the maple syrup and balsamic vinegar. The earthy thyme couples nicely with the sweetness too.
cde56261-38a3-4f67-8297-4247d799ef7a;EatingWell Member;5;First off I never understood the value of a potato much less the skin but to have this excellent post peeking recipe sure saves on waste of one does not have peel eating animals or fowl or a garden.Over the years I have wasted oh so many peels but never again. Thankful for the tip to immediately season as well
cde56261-38a3-4f67-8297-4247d799ef7a;EatingWell Member;4;What a fun way to use up the scraps from your potatoes! Waste not, want not! These get delightfully crispy and are perfectly salty. That alone is a reason to make them!
cde56261-38a3-4f67-8297-4247d799ef7a;EatingWell Member;4;These are way better than I had expected. Crispy, salty, and easy to make!
cde56261-38a3-4f67-8297-4247d799ef7a;EatingWell Member;5;Crispy, well seasoned, and a fun alternative to potato chips if you love the skins of potatoes.
e605be7e-3bbe-4fcb-a18e-e88fb6cc5bd4;EatingWell Member;5;I loved this salad that was surprisingly reminiscent of a Caesar. The sweetness of the roasted cabbage works great with the umami-packed dressing.
e605be7e-3bbe-4fcb-a18e-e88fb6cc5bd4;EatingWell Member;5;Like Caesar salad meets roasted vegetables. I love the peppery parmesan dressing. So simple and so tasty.
21a0bd34-b945-4a47-80ef-4652a418612f;EatingWell Member;5;It was so easy to prepare and so delicious!! Thanks for the recipe. Everyone should make this recipe, you won’t regret it.
21a0bd34-b945-4a47-80ef-4652a418612f;EatingWell Member;5;Loved them! It took me less than 20 minutes to make them! Very fresh, healthy, colorful, and delicious meal!I used panela cheese and instead of avocado used a bit of mayonnaise!
b0c9aca1-9669-4f80-8803-0c3fa27e49d7;Ellen;5;"I changed the instructions to say ""white wine vinegar"" instead of red as the image of the prepared vinaigrette was definitely made with white. My choice is Champagne vinegar."
200ea260-0d23-41e0-aa5c-04912822f122;Vianna Heath;4;Am going to get the ingredients & try it. Looking forward to a hearty, different breakfast
200ea260-0d23-41e0-aa5c-04912822f122;EatingWell Member;5;Best protein muffins I've ever made! I've never used cottage cheese before in a muffin, and it made the crumb light and fluffy.
200ea260-0d23-41e0-aa5c-04912822f122;EatingWell Member;5;Super tender and moist! You can't even taste the flavor of the whole wheat flour. The fresh blueberries, honey, milk, and cottage cheese add moisture to the muffin, making it light.
e91e30ab-320a-46d8-a8ad-b6d85606ac73;darkvictory39;5;Trying to reply to other review…Probably don’t coverWith foil or anything will make the cabbage crisp. Just let it broil open and that should give it a good “grilled” texture
e91e30ab-320a-46d8-a8ad-b6d85606ac73;EatingWell Member;4;I followed the recipe without many changes. I enjoyed it. I wished the cabbage was more crispy as only the edges of mine got crispy. My 'pizza' was not able to be picked up, so I had to use a knife and fork. It was tasty. It served as my main course but it certainly could be a nice side dish. It will be fun to explore some different toppings and figure out a way to make the cabbage a bit more crispy.
55c8077b-e023-4e69-b529-bf0652990041;EatingWell Member;4;This is a really unique recipe yielding an end result of a vegan product that actually looks and feels like bacon. It's hard to mimic the flavor of actual pork bacon, but the marinade and texture work together to give us the savory, umami flavor that we associate with bacon.What pleasantly surprised me most was how similar to cooked bacon these look. They start to sizzle on the bacon sheet in the oven and each strip kind of fuses together as they're baking.
55c8077b-e023-4e69-b529-bf0652990041;EatingWell Member;4;Looks so much like bacon! The flavor is salty, sweet, and slightly bitter and the texture is crisp yet soft in spots.
dc889c64-6b68-431e-b04a-1f762242b122;EatingWell Member;5;did not have lemon, so did not add at the end. This turned out really good. Nice flavor. Highly recommend. I used white onion instead of shallott as that was what i had. Try it!

632c2c1b-614a-4e01-bf2c-a432020045b9;EatingWell Member;4;Earthy and slightly sweet, with a nutty creaminess from the tahini and hummus. The creamy, tender avocado adds this satisfying indulgent texture and flavor that makes this not feel too light.
632c2c1b-614a-4e01-bf2c-a432020045b9;EatingWell Member;4;Never thought of using fresh beets this way. So fun! It pairs nicely with the avocado and hummus.
47be22e9-4318-45b6-a78a-8156f77fcebf;EatingWell Member;5;This is an umami-laden dish. Tender mushrooms soak up the tart/sweet balsamic while nutty/salty parmesan rounds everything out and makes this feel elevated.
47be22e9-4318-45b6-a78a-8156f77fcebf;EatingWell Member;5;I liked the tender cook of the mushrooms and the acidity of the balsamic vinegar. The umami of the cheese went well with the mushrooms. It was simple recipe.
a8a9d0b9-ac75-49b2-b1a1-3c98f2e8cb6d;EatingWell Member;5;Love the creaminess of the avocado against the crunch of the cucumber.
a8a9d0b9-ac75-49b2-b1a1-3c98f2e8cb6d;EatingWell Member;5;Really lovely, bright flavor. I’m loving the textures going on in this. Soft, silky avocado, crunchy, fresh cucumber, wonderfully flavorful dressed greens. The green goddess dressing isn’t as thick as some, and a little goes a long way. I’d love this in salad form too, but the wrap makes it fun and more of a kid-friendly feeling option.
f3ded1a7-1ae8-4ded-92ba-9244cdcd6760;EatingWell Member;2;Easy to make but not enough lemon flavour for my liking I would not make again
f3ded1a7-1ae8-4ded-92ba-9244cdcd6760;EatingWell Member;4;I used toasted pumpkin seeds because both my children are allergic to nuts. A little chewy, but really delicious! I plan to try sunflower seeds next.
f3ded1a7-1ae8-4ded-92ba-9244cdcd6760;EatingWell Member;5;I like that these are like overnight oats, but warm, and in a bite! Fresh blueberries provide a nice pop of tart-sweetness, and the subtle vanilla and lemon flavor is great.
f3ded1a7-1ae8-4ded-92ba-9244cdcd6760;EatingWell Member;4;Delightful crunch from the almonds to break up the chewy oats and the bursting blueberries. So good!
f3ded1a7-1ae8-4ded-92ba-9244cdcd6760;Mary;4;Please- can I substitute Almond milk? It sounds delicious!
41fad42c-df3f-4569-8fe1-5b41377d85a2;EatingWell Member;5;I hate Brussels Sprouts, but when you make them with these ingredients, who can not love them?! They were better for lunch today, than they were last night.
e3fc05e9-72e5-42d2-93cd-b64cf3534d91;Ben;4;"The recipe looks good, but... what kind of a measurement is ""slices"" of anything. How about measuring in ounces?"
e3fc05e9-72e5-42d2-93cd-b64cf3534d91;EatingWell Member;5;i used bacon in lieu of ham, this is close to being my all time favorite
e3fc05e9-72e5-42d2-93cd-b64cf3534d91;EatingWell Member;5;These potatoes live up to their name and then some! They totally melt in your mouth, ends of potatoes are a bit crispier and the skin is tender but provides a nice toothsome edge, while still gentle. Warm sage, marjoram and prosciutto make it decadent, unique, and special, but classic salt and pepper and butter really bring it back to earth.
e3fc05e9-72e5-42d2-93cd-b64cf3534d91;EatingWell Member;5;Great side dish for a steak dinner or a roasted pork tenderloin.
800ffbb1-e6ac-4f3b-8482-8a0d8895a42b;RAG2325;5;This salad was a delicious surprise. I already had pickled onions I made a couple of days ago with the same basic ingredients. The dressing was flavorful and the family enjoyed the salad very much.
6e33b8b6-a7c1-4404-a477-bddf9c923cb8;EatingWell Member;5;I used Cod and butterflied the filets (because there were very thick). This was delicious! And super easy too!
6e33b8b6-a7c1-4404-a477-bddf9c923cb8;EatingWell Member;4;I love the smokiness of the smoked paprika and chipotle pepper. It adds a lot of flavors but not heat. The cooling yogurt sauce was my favorite, which would taste great with smoky, grilled dishes.
6e33b8b6-a7c1-4404-a477-bddf9c923cb8;EatingWell Member;5;Great recipe! The fish is tender and spicy and flakes so easily. The slaw is crunchy, the sauce is spicy and creamy, and the avocado is delicious.
6e33b8b6-a7c1-4404-a477-bddf9c923cb8;EatingWell Member;5;I love the heat in the spice mixture with the tender fish and creamy avocado. So good!
6e33b8b6-a7c1-4404-a477-bddf9c923cb8;EatingWell Member;5;So easy and super flavorful. Enjoyed eating this for lunch!
6fca935f-e5ce-46cd-9a9f-7d2ee8ca7db3;EatingWell Member;4;Next time, I will add more seasoning, however, I did not have any dill so that could have been the difference. My husband had 2 bowls.
6fca935f-e5ce-46cd-9a9f-7d2ee8ca7db3;EatingWell Member;5;Would not make any changes.
4355e8c1-2f46-4b39-84c8-f51d43c8fc71;EatingWell Member;5;"I would put this sauce on anything and everything; it has the perfect amount of heat and spice. It's basically an everything sauce."
4355e8c1-2f46-4b39-84c8-f51d43c8fc71;EatingWell Member;5;I was surprised this was so healthy! The sauce is rich and spicy, and the chicken is well-seasoned and crispy!

f10c9347-fccb-4c45-a6df-e3c3bd3037c8;Jennifer Morton;5;It was delicious!
f10c9347-fccb-4c45-a6df-e3c3bd3037c8;EatingWell Member;5;good
f10c9347-fccb-4c45-a6df-e3c3bd3037c8;EatingWell Member;5;Super flavorful, you can taste the chipotle peppers that the chicken was marinated in. The pineapple juice helps tenderize the chicken in just the right amount.
f10c9347-fccb-4c45-a6df-e3c3bd3037c8;EatingWell Member;5;The spicy/sweet combination of the adobo with honey and fresh pineapple is delicious. I love the charred outside with the sweet glaze-like coating. The grilled pineapple and creamy avocado are excellent alongside the chicken.
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;3;We made bean patties 50+ years ago when we couldn’t afford meat. They have been around a lot time.
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;suevellagmailcom;5;"Excellent! What a super site this is; a real discovery. Thank you"
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;4;Regular (non-vegan) Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies which would not be suitable for either vegans or vegetarians. Many (most?) vegetarians eat eggs, so this recipe using vegan Worcestershire sauce and eggs would be appropriate for most vegetarians.
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;3;Well as the egg negates vegetarian and vegan eaters, why bother with vegan worchestershire??
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;5;The cumin is a great addition to the patties because it brings a lovely warmth. These are filling, easy to make, and perfect for meal prepping at the beginning of a busy week.
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;5;Super tasty burger! you can really taste the cumin, would be fun to use as salad toppers!
75d88084-5a1f-46b4-a400-382873679530;EatingWell Member;5;"Super quick and easy burger! The Worchestshire and cumin really shine through and create a well rounded flavor. the texture was also perfect, not to mushy! Baking them created a nice ""crust"" on the outside."
b4eaada5-2d44-4661-9b12-fe04b0fe7b55;Penelope Wall;5;This dish was really great and satisfying for a vegetarian main. I misread the ingredients and made with toasted sesame oil, which had a strong flavor stacked up with the cider. Will definitely make again with regular sesame oil. My carrots were kind of big and old (not the tender carrots you find with tops on). I found I had to cook for 10 minutes more than suggested for them to get tender enough. I also had more than a pound on the sheet-pan, so that probably added to cook time, but still came out great. Tip: if you have leftovers, store the sauce and carrots separately. The sauce curdled for me when I reheated in the microwave.
b4eaada5-2d44-4661-9b12-fe04b0fe7b55;EatingWell Member;5;Super delicious! Carrots are super tender, and the garbanzo beans crisp up just enough but are still soft.
b4eaada5-2d44-4661-9b12-fe04b0fe7b55;EatingWell Member;5;AMAZING. This would make a perfect Thanksgiving side dish. The tahini complements the sesame oil and balances out the sweetness of the maple syrup. Super delicious one-pan side dish.
b4eaada5-2d44-4661-9b12-fe04b0fe7b55;EatingWell Member;5;Tender carrots and crispy garbanzo beans with a creamy tahini drizzle. The flavors work so well together. Would make this any night of the week!
072fc902-9b90-457f-a502-22d5eea1668f;Nicole Kletzka;5;This was delicious and easy to make.
072fc902-9b90-457f-a502-22d5eea1668f;EatingWell Member;5;"I love the sweetness from the raisins here -- they balance the smokey Harissa. I would also use the white bean salad as a ""chicken"" salad."
072fc902-9b90-457f-a502-22d5eea1668f;EatingWell Member;5;I love the sweet warmth of the ras al hanout alongside the creamy beans and spicy harissa. This is refreshing and light and comes together easily.
4c1fb264-d2d9-4017-ac8b-d8e75260f9bb;Jessica Ball;5;love this recipe! I added a light cornstarch dredge to help the sesame seeds stick and make the tofu a little more crispy, super delicious!
4c1fb264-d2d9-4017-ac8b-d8e75260f9bb;EatingWell Member;5;I LOVE tofu, especially when coated with crunchy sesame seeds. The slaw is tangy, bright, and acidic and tastes great with the nutty tofu steaks.
4c1fb264-d2d9-4017-ac8b-d8e75260f9bb;EatingWell Member;5;I love the technique of coating the tofu in seeds. The sesame adds a nutty flavor and a crunchy texture. I can never really crisp my tofu in the oven or skillet, but the sesame seeds guarantee a crunch.
cadec54e-665f-403a-98e9-7d9c9abc10fd;EatingWell Member;4;I made this at home and added some shaved Parmesan -- so lovely! Love the bright, herbaceous vinaigrette against the briny olives.
cadec54e-665f-403a-98e9-7d9c9abc10fd;EatingWell Member;5;I love how fast this is to pull together, but it's not dull! A great salad that has no fuss and would easily impress.
42dd5b5c-db98-4d02-972d-b73b236d6a7b;EatingWell Member;4;I'm not usually a fan of runny yolk (I know, I'm weird), but I love how it creates a creamy sauce for the lentils. The pops of sweetness from the tomatoes might be my favorite part of this dish.
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;conz81wildthing;5;This looks so good,I like oriental salad,so I know I would love this.YUMMY
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;N2deewind;5;We enjoyed this as a main dish light dinner. I admit to grating a teaspoon or 2 of ginger in, being VERY liberal with garlic, adding sriracha and using more lime juice and less oil, but I thought this was a fantastic base recipe.It’s the right kind of crunchy and very refreshing with the lime juice base. I used half of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. Will make again.
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;abbyz2000;3;This was okay but I won't make it again. It made 6 servings, not 4. I didn't have any mint, so maybe it would have been better with it.
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;EatingWell Member;4;Flavors = 10/10. If I use napa cabbage again, I will not let it sit in the dressing to prevent wilting. Such a tasty salad otherwise.
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;EatingWell Member;5;I really liked this recipe. It reminded me of a simple bun xao. Usually bun xao is done with beef but I tried the chicken and put it over rice sticks. It was good, but next time I will add some lemon grass and chili peppers. Great summertime meal!
