66df54be-9bf8-4e02-81da-1fa69ec194ac;EatingWell Member;5;There are tons of fresh flavors packed in these meatballs, particularly the briny salmon and the grassy dill. The salty feta, coupled with the tomatoes, bring lots of umami.
66df54be-9bf8-4e02-81da-1fa69ec194ac;EatingWell Member;4;I don't often have canned salmon in my house, but when I do, I'm making these. These would be great to add to a salad or stuff into a pita pocket.

48b87645-5ea3-47d4-aa82-5e07b5ade660;EatingWell Member;5;This was a perfect balance of sweet and tart from the blueberries and lemon. The kale was barely noticeable! Love hiding greens in smoothies.
48b87645-5ea3-47d4-aa82-5e07b5ade660;EatingWell Member;5;This smoothie is tart from the blueberries and sweet from the banana. It is well balanced by the brightness of the lemon coupled with the bitter kale and tea. A very refreshing, quick breakfast.
e7504280-01bd-4c27-aae6-21c8229f8fe9;EatingWell Member;5;I made it exactly as written. Very good. I will be making it again.
cbb87adf-fae3-4d3e-a34e-1b8ae8344940;Marcia Hiruo;5;Sounds good.If you do not have fresh ginger, can you use ground ginger?
83abfcc3-28fc-427b-be65-3e2b0a6e7dc9;EatingWell Member;5;This tofu has wonderful texture and brings a lot to the table (literally!) Satisfying and complex -- wouldn't have guessed that it's vegan!
76c69e0f-d391-41e3-958d-ad5cde8e8718;EatingWell Member;5;This was great! We made our salmon in the air fryer, and it turned out great. The mayo sauce will brown, but does not interfere with taste. Put our veggies in the oven at 380 for about 25 mins and then broiled. Added some lemon juice and it was a great little dinner with good flavor!
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;Jennifer Edwards;5;Really good and rich even though I only used half the cream cheese, no fontina cheese, chickpea pasta, and milk instead of half and half. Also used grilled chicken strips and skipped the oven.
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;EatingWell Member;2;Too high carb for this senior citizen and where would I find the sundried tomato oil? Disappointed. It looks good, but poison for me!
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;EatingWell Member;3;3 stars b/c I plan to make this with as many fat free products as possible. Looks like a great recipe though.
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;joshuaddiazfranco;5;The good things about this recipe is that you can customize it to your liking best. I did it without an oven, since I don't have any, simply cooked all the ingredients separately then mixed them all. What I found is that one half of the cheese is more than adequate if not oven cooked, otherwise is great delicious.
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;EatingWell Member;5;I did used more veggies,Italian tomato sauce and ground chicken meatballs..
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;EatingWell Member;5;Super tasty and rich! The cream sauce coats the pasta and chicken perfectly. This bake is also jam-packed with spinach. This is a healthy dish that is filling and tasty!
504e390d-d93d-43fc-b3bf-829d5303485b;EatingWell Member;5;It's a wonderful pasta bake with tons of tomatoey goodness! It's creamy with lots of depth of flavor and a lovely cheesy finish from the fontina.
1ffe61b3-f7b7-4174-a3b5-66e025abf34b;EatingWell Member;5;This was delicious
1ffe61b3-f7b7-4174-a3b5-66e025abf34b;EatingWell Member;4;I'll be trying this without the meat, adding black beans instead.
1ffe61b3-f7b7-4174-a3b5-66e025abf34b;EatingWell Member;4;This is filling and tasty! It's super cheesy and has a great amount of flavor from the Cajun seasoning.
1ffe61b3-f7b7-4174-a3b5-66e025abf34b;EatingWell Member;5;This worked well as a food mash-up it's uber-beefy and savory, like the OG Philly cheesesteak.
73e0e585-9035-46b8-a74c-e9ac59a4fd9e;EatingWell Member;5;Black eyed peas and collard greens are already a great mix, but the addition of the peppers, spice and citrus are a game changer. Delicious!
d74187b1-0130-4c2f-8a2c-b4b7f15e6b0e;EatingWell Member;5;I love roasted cauliflower. I've used olive oil in the past instead of butter but this sounds intriguing. Will make it this way next time.
d74187b1-0130-4c2f-8a2c-b4b7f15e6b0e;EatingWell Member;5;Fantastic
d74187b1-0130-4c2f-8a2c-b4b7f15e6b0e;Janet Callahan;5;Tastes great. Wonderful easy to serve.

a6a08e9b-f0bf-4bba-991e-1d3e90a91e68;EatingWell Member;5;Really love this salad. A lot going on, but it's one that keeps you coming back for satisfying bites. Juicy/charry chicken coated in bbq sauce, creamy Monterey jack that clings to the lettuce and chicken, bright/creamy dressing, lots of brightness from the fresh and dried herbs.
a6a08e9b-f0bf-4bba-991e-1d3e90a91e68;EatingWell Member;5;Tons of flavor and the jicama is a nice surprise!
0f76e53f-473d-4bb7-ae07-348c43e2b7da;EatingWell Member;4;Earthy and slightly sweet, with a nutty creaminess from the tahini and hummus. The creamy, tender avocado adds this satisfying indulgent texture and flavor that makes this not feel too light.
0f76e53f-473d-4bb7-ae07-348c43e2b7da;EatingWell Member;4;Never thought of using fresh beets this way. So fun! It pairs nicely with the avocado and hummus.
ba41f65e-d4d8-499e-8a57-ba19c534cc49;EatingWell Member;5;I doubled this recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan. Everyone raved about it!
ba41f65e-d4d8-499e-8a57-ba19c534cc49;D.K;5;Good üëç website
ba41f65e-d4d8-499e-8a57-ba19c534cc49;EatingWell Member;5;It's creamy, yet substantial and with a crispy topping everything you'd want in a casserole. I feel almost guilty eating it because it feels like I'm eating dip for dinner! But I'm not! It's great!
44cb0c29-5fbc-4eec-a6d9-d96447c144d6;EatingWell Member;5;The gochujang sauce is incredible and makes the whole dish sing!
44cb0c29-5fbc-4eec-a6d9-d96447c144d6;EatingWell Member;5;I love that there's some subtle heat‚Äîwhich you can choose to kick up a notch if you like, but not necessary. The beef is well seasoned and pleasantly aromatic with white onion, but not overpowering‚Äîthe crunch of fresh veggies and brown rice rounds out the dish and carries the seasoning in each bite. Perfect for a summer's day lunch.
42f1f664-55a8-4c3e-9cc6-4a91c3a98179;tporter549;5;Loved this dish and the instructions were easy to followüëç
42f1f664-55a8-4c3e-9cc6-4a91c3a98179;EatingWell Member;5;"Regarding the confusion by the person who posted the question, ""...what is cup of half and half of what!"", half-and-half is simply a mixture of half whole milk and half cream. It's usually sold with the name, ""Half and Half."""
42f1f664-55a8-4c3e-9cc6-4a91c3a98179;EatingWell Member;1;Who has all these ingrediants in there kitchen or understands all the ingediant names and where to get them also what is cup of half and half of what!Apaart from that looks good but to complicated to many ingrediantsfor me alone to tackle for myself alone
42f1f664-55a8-4c3e-9cc6-4a91c3a98179;EatingWell Member;5;Cozy, creamy, and lemony! Perfect easy rainy day dinner.
42f1f664-55a8-4c3e-9cc6-4a91c3a98179;EatingWell Member;5;Creamy, comforting, and so bright and flavorful. The lemon really shines through and takes a typical baked pasta to a new level. The fontina is mild, yet brings a nutty earthy flavor which works perfectly with the lemon. The recipe recommends a few grinds of fresh black pepper, and I recommend a few more. Lemon + pepper = yum.
af2f5829-7b8d-4aa6-8d13-efc290059512;EatingWell Member;4;Now this is an interesting concept...a fun way to serve dip! The dip is savory and delicious creamy and tasting just like a baked potato!
835e49be-0700-4780-9963-c712dfd43373;EatingWell Member;5;Hearty chili that's a perfect dupe for the classic Wendy's chili. I loved the tomato sauce base. It made the chili smooth and saucy.
835e49be-0700-4780-9963-c712dfd43373;EatingWell Member;5;This tastes so close to Wendy's chili and is dead easy to make. I like my chili on the spicy side, so I'd probably add some cayenne pepper.
e8eb94ba-932a-4583-95aa-3a0df2f63ed9;EatingWell Member;4;I liked how the Cajun seasoning on the shrimp really stood out it eats like Cajun fried rice. Hot sauce was a must for me.
e8eb94ba-932a-4583-95aa-3a0df2f63ed9;EatingWell Member;5;The Cajun seasoning is the star of this dish! It adds so much flavor to both the shrimp and the cauliflower rice. This is an easy weeknight dinner that will be on rotation in my house.
580bc18f-fa0d-44b2-81ab-890986fb0c4f;EatingWell Member;5;The roasted cauliflower & curry soup is creamy and the soup is very curry-forward. The soup will thicken over time, so additional liquid may be needed to thin it out again.
580bc18f-fa0d-44b2-81ab-890986fb0c4f;EatingWell Member;4;Bright, acidic, and creamy! I love the combination of cauliflower, coconut milk, red curry, and lime juice.
51ae3e99-d39a-4581-afbd-88bdac4f5f04;Nicole Kletzka;5;This was delicious and easy to make.
51ae3e99-d39a-4581-afbd-88bdac4f5f04;EatingWell Member;5;"I love the sweetness from the raisins here -- they balance the smokey Harissa. I would also use the white bean salad as a ""chicken"" salad."
51ae3e99-d39a-4581-afbd-88bdac4f5f04;EatingWell Member;5;I love the sweet warmth of the ras al hanout alongside the creamy beans and spicy harissa. This is refreshing and light and comes together easily.
4a418504-e16c-4fbb-95d9-b5888508157b;HelenD;5;Very good! The family (with varying tastes) all liked it. I used store-bought tortilla chips crumbled on top, instead of the tortilla strips. Also offered sliced green onions and sour cream as additional toppings. Very tasty, easy & quick -- a keeper!
4a418504-e16c-4fbb-95d9-b5888508157b;EatingWell Member;5;Assuming that you want to shape sizzling shoulders like Jennifer Aniston or Chris Hemsworth (those two have shoulder objectives composed all over them) ‚Äî these seven hand weight shoulder practices develop fortitude, muscle and 3D definition.
4a418504-e16c-4fbb-95d9-b5888508157b;EatingWell Member;5;I'd make this on the regular! Great flavors happening here, from the enchilada sauce and steak.
4a418504-e16c-4fbb-95d9-b5888508157b;EatingWell Member;4;This is a very adaptable recipe, like a burrito bowl but in a skillet. I'm not a fan of saucy tortilla strips, but I love the flavorful sauce, which packs in some yummy veggies and protein. Would definitely make this for a crowd and try corn tortillas.
7a48fcd1-d47c-4642-a025-12360efa56fc;EatingWell Member;4;I'm not usually a fan of runny yolk (I know, I'm weird), but I love how it creates a creamy sauce for the lentils. The pops of sweetness from the tomatoes might be my favorite part of this dish.
2dd53af2-9df1-4c2a-8888-bcebc4bff88b;EatingWell Member;5;So quick and easy and super flavorful. The grits are just cheesy enough, with a subtle smoky flavor. I love how the lemon butter sauce melds with the blackened seasoning to create a flavorful coating that seeps into the grits.
2dd53af2-9df1-4c2a-8888-bcebc4bff88b;EatingWell Member;5;The shrimp is delightfully buttery, and I like the extra sauce to swirl into the grits. The lemon is a must it sharpens the flavors and gives everything a little oomph.
93fd7ec6-6b51-4197-94bd-9fce42e93eb6;Mort;5;I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was was delicious. I especially liked the strong umami flavor of the glaze. I served it with roasted broccoli. Excellent!
93fd7ec6-6b51-4197-94bd-9fce42e93eb6;EatingWell Member;5;Squeezing the remaining fresh lime juice over the cooked fillets helps balance out the salty, umami flavor of the red miso and helps tone it down just a tad without losing its delicious flavor profile.
93fd7ec6-6b51-4197-94bd-9fce42e93eb6;EatingWell Member;5;Love this recipe! So easy and has so much flavor! You really need the lime wedges to balance the curry miso.
83f966be-2b43-4833-92e9-867ac24eb7cd;EatingWell Member;5;The creator of this dish will probably cringe. We made a fair amount of adjustments. I just want to say thank you for bringing all of these great flavors together in the way that you did! It was an amazing experience!Adjustments:Soak salmon in milk for 20-30 minutes.Reduced the dill. Sprinkled with the vegetables.Used red pepper flake-infused olive oil.Added Kalamata olives.Didn't use the dressing.Pan-fried the asparagus and mixed into the dish at the end.Spritzed lemon juice over the dish at the end.Next time we may substitute some of the stock for white wine.Comiendo Feliz!
83f966be-2b43-4833-92e9-867ac24eb7cd;EatingWell Member;5;Very quick and easy to follow. I used a small jar of capers and swapped salmon for cod which worked well. Baked this in a Ninja Grill... I will try this again with pan seared chicken thighs and see how that comes out.
83f966be-2b43-4833-92e9-867ac24eb7cd;EatingWell Member;5;Just had this tonight for myself and boyfriend. We absolutely loved it and it was so pretty! I was a little light on tomatoes and asparagus and it was still great. I will repurpose the orzo with some chicken breasts cooked separately as we had a lot leftover.There were so many different taste sensations which is something we enjoy! Thank you for this great recipe!
83f966be-2b43-4833-92e9-867ac24eb7cd;EatingWell Member;4;The recipes has good directions, easy and good flavor. Clean up was easy since I only used a casserole dish. I cut the recipe in half however I doubled the amount lemon and capers used. We enjoy a very lemony taste. I also made it with wild caught sockeye salmon.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and used gluten free flour. Turned out great and plenty for two plus leftovers.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;oneota77gmailcom;5;This was delicious, even without the Parmesan. My 10 year old went back for thirds! I added smoked paprika as that is what we had on hand. Will definitely make this again.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;This is really something special. The sauce is unique and flavorful. I followed the recipe and measurements to a T and the result is so good, I really can't believe I made it!!!
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;3;Comes across as a side dish more than a main. That being the case I'd probably leave out the chicken and add some more veggies to the spinach mixture, which can also benefit from a bit more lemon and maybe some parmesan. I'd also leave off the mozzarella cheese on top, as it doesn't add any particular texture or flavor and instead do some panko or cracker crumbs of some sort and a bit of parmesan. It's not bad, just a little dull on the palate.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;I love how seasoned this dish is -- the Boursin packs a solid punch, but so do all the spices! It's super creamy and feels decadent.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;This tastes like a stuffed shell -- I'm a big fan. I'd make this on the regular!
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;This would be the dish if Greek-style spinach pie married a chicken casserole! It's creamy, a little spicy, and has the perfect amount of lemon to brighten up the heartier grains and chicken.
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;nichkj;4;I know it says 8 servings but how much is 1 serving? 1 cup? 1 1/2 cups?
0d1b175c-4299-4b05-a479-146d9aa10460;EatingWell Member;5;Haven't cooked yet but I finally found some casseroles I was looking for. The salmon casserole will be my first. Thank you for these wonderful recipes.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;This recipe is a winner. I made it with 3 cups rice which seemed enough. The rice incorporates in with the rest. You may want a little more seasoning, but we thought it was good as is. I might steam the broccoli before combining with rice next time. Baked it for 40 minutes covered and 2 min under the broiler uncovered. It does take time to prepare. I don't understand these reviews by people who didn't make it - come on.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;Susan Quinn;1;No I didn't make it because some directions are weird. Says to take 6 cups of cooked rice (how many people is this supposed to serve?) which seems like a lot.Then a serving size is 1 cup? At that rate, we'd starve. That means that the calorie count is much higher than the 417 calories stated because we'd need to eat more than 1 cup.And I have found that a lot of the Eating Well recipes are far too tasteless so if I were to make this, I'd jazz it up a LOT!
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;Erica Powell;2;This recipe took way longer than stated in the directions to prep and cook. 6 cups of cooked rice was way too much, I think it made it take longer in the oven for all the ingredients to bake together (40 mins), and it made it dry. I would reduce the rice to 3 cups like others have commented above to see if it comes out better. I unfortunately will not be making this again.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;gesataline;5;I have made the recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It looked and tasted delicious. It‚Äôs hard to go wrong with some cream cheese, sour cream and a bit of real bacon.The second time I used what I had on hand. I subbed barley for the brown rice and cauliflower for the broccoli. I kept everything else the same. It was an even bigger hit It‚Äôs definitely a keeper for our Fall and Winter cozy suppers.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;1;The recipe steps made no sense. The amount of ingredients did not correlate. We eat late as it is and trying to fix this recipe had us eating even later.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;4;I did not have all the ingredients, so I replaced sour cream with yogurt and chicken breast meat with chicken thigh, and added a extra tin of chickpeas to stretch it a little more.... it was simply delishious..... it will definitely become a regular dish in our home
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;No I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶..I can‚Äôt cook it but my wife of 28 years will make it and ‚Äúwe‚Äù will test it out.üòè
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;Roxy;1;I wasted valuable money, time & excitement for this recipe :(. Pay attention to the 1 star reviews. I LOVE this app. But I am devastated this recipe was such a cshow. I can‚Äôt afford to buy these ingredients where the recipe brings me to a complete mess.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;llamacat;4;I'm not sure why Eating Well is publishing casserole recipes in August (isn't it grilling season?), but I decided to try this and it turned out delicious. I used only 3 cups of cooked rice and agree that 6 cups would be too much rice. If this is a misprint in the recipe, please fix it! The only other change I made was I did not add sour cream, because I forgot to buy it. Instead, I added about 1/4 c of heavy cream that I happened to have in the fridge, because I was worried it would be too dry without the sour cream. Reminds me of the chicken broccoli casserole my mom used to make, but tastier and healthier! Gonna try the creamed spinach and chicken casserole next week.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;1;This instructions for this recipe are all over the place. Cooked way too much rice. Only used the amount of rice that matched the chicken and broccoli amount. The flavor is not good at all. If you are reading this review, do yourself a favor and find a better recipe instead of having a large casserole going to waste.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;JLJENNA;4;It's it 6 or 3 cups of cooked rice??!! Says 6 but someone says otherwise. I just made 6 and it does look like too much! I don't think it says the right amount of broth either! 1/4 is absorbed the minute you put it into a pot of three (or 6) cups of rice! I'm trying a cup and a quarter. The broccoli won't get tender without liquid.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;Made this last night, and the whole family loved it. Made it even easier by using precooked brown rice and rotisserie chicken.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;Great weekday dish for a crowd who loves cheesy dishes.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;I haven't tried it yet, but I am going too, it sounds Delicious!!!!! I just want to say, I am surprised at the haters.......ü§î
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;Jamie;5;Delicious just make sure you only make 3 cups of cooked rice for the recipe I might have misread the recipe but I figured it out before it was too late. Very flavorful highly recommend.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;This sounds great! And for all those who just want to argue about its healthfulness, maybe you should just substitute for any ingredients that you don‚Äôt agree with.
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;I think it sounds delicious even though I‚Äôm not a rice fan. To the member that thought it was unhealthy because of the ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù cream cheese, have you never heard of Neufch√¢tel cheese??? All natural, no sugar added!!
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;1;"If it's ""healthy"" why would you use ANYTHING that is fat free or reduced fat???? Reduced or no fat means MORE sugar, sugar is bad!"
61103775-1429-4a5b-8560-5df858885d84;EatingWell Member;5;Sounds and taste fantastic!

734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;EatingWell Member;1;Completely unintelligible recipe to the 95% of the world's population that don't live in the USA
734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;EatingWell Member;5;Husband loved it. Used 2% cheddar instead of Gouda.
734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;helenp;5;This was a bit labour intensive but so worth it! I made no changes to the recipe. Very flavourful. I froze the leftover chipotles for the next time I make this. Based on family reviews that will be soon.
734dfb7c-1728-40fe-9274-ca5c249db610;EatingWell Member;5;Great way to have something decadent without the guilt. The gouda and cream cheese combo give the sauce a creamy tomatoey finish that would please anyone.

f9b7d664-4b4c-4ffa-9e37-92a7ae9189f2;EatingWell Member;3;"The recipe seemed like it would be good, but i just wasn't sure how to rate it. I know that a lot of cultures have takes on similar recipes, but gumbo in the United States is not originally French, Cajun, or from Cameroon in it's origin. It was a Cherokee dish for generations before any new world settlers ever set a toe in this country. It did however, undergo several transformations and became one of the first ""fusion"" dishes here. As settlers made their exit from the northeast, away from Colonial territory, to the Ozarks, to the Blue Ridge Mountains, to the Smokey Mountains, to the Appalachians, and down the Appalachian trail, etc, they eventually got to Cherokee land where Georgia and North Carolina meet, with Tennessee and South Carolina in close proximity. And of course the Irish, French, and Germans in particular, all added different elements from their homeland and came away with unique versions of the recipe. It's very similar to the emergence of Pizza at Ellis Island preceeding this. What the Italians called pizza in Italy was just what we know as bruschetta. It was basically like kids trading what they had at the lunch table for someone else's. Eventually different cheeses, meats, and vegetables got added to what other immigrants got from the Italians to try. But in it's finished form pizza emerged completely American. My family is Cherokee and German right down the middle. So we cook rice in chicken stock, with stewed tomatoes, clarified onions, salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, , sometimes cumin or coriander sparingly, east coast white shrimp or crawfish, okra(with a bite to it still, not broken down to an extreme), a mix of polska keilbasa and andouille, and hot sauce, which is more ground garden peppers and sugar base like Texas Pete's or Franks, than a vinegar base like Louisiana hot sauce i guess you could say. Didn't mean to ramble just giving you my take."

4fdf3f9c-f92c-4f32-bf3e-180f4e290ccc;EatingWell Member;5;This is a perfect dinner/meal prep option. I feel great about getting all of my macros & lots of delicious veggies. I made a couple small changes.. I crockpot cooked the chicken in broth & used it shredded in the dish. I skipped the Gruy√®re (honestly forgot to buy it, but it was excellent without). And I used about half the amount of quinoa recommended. I am saving this one to make again!
4fdf3f9c-f92c-4f32-bf3e-180f4e290ccc;EatingWell Member;5;Summer veggies and tender/nutty quinoa come together in this casserole to provide a ratatouille-reminiscent moment. The veggies are all tender, with a nice browning on the eggplant. The gruyere brings another nutty/salty flavor, while the fresh mozz and tomatoes add pops of color and freshness.

c84ded22-9520-4e1b-8380-3ee0e08a0416;EatingWell Member;5;I like this method for making the cheese sauce. There's no chance cheese will be stuck to the bottom of your pan after making it. It's very creamy and comforting and will satisfy your carb cravings.

8e5297e8-b7fe-47b6-83a4-3f8fac243177;Deb;4;Great recipe. I can't wait to try it. Disappointed however that you are promoting the use of inflammatory oil such as grapeseed which is so harmful to human health. Olive oil is the go-to for salad dressings!
8e5297e8-b7fe-47b6-83a4-3f8fac243177;EatingWell Member;2;The salad was ok, but instructions for making it were awful!!There was no info about how to use gas grill or regular grill to cook vegetables (and chicken). The lettuce was cut into halves in one part of recipe and was suddenly chopped in another part - how & when did that happen? Do veggies grill on the baking sheet or somehow on the grill? There are a lot of ingredients in this recipe!! In my opinion, more concise instructions need to be instructions included in order to call this a recipe!!

7909d923-f0c3-408b-bea2-e6febd3d8c6a;jangle5757;5;It seems unfair to rate as I did not follow the recipe exactly though it was close. First off, I realized I was out of balsamic vinegar but I did have white balsamic so used that. Then I was halving the recipe so rather than have a half of a 28oz can of tomatoes leftover, I used a can of plain tomato sauce and added chopped up fresh plum tomatoes that I peeled. I also dislike fennel and red pepper so those were omitted but left in the garlic and basil. I also did not have the ricotta salata so I just grated some Romano cheese over it though I would like to try it with the ricotta salata. I really liked what I ended up with and even went back for seconds. It was a new way to use eggplant that I recommend.
7909d923-f0c3-408b-bea2-e6febd3d8c6a;EatingWell Member;5;Sorry not a review but a question. The recipe sounds wonderful except for the balsamic. What could be substituted for the balsamic?

The dressing will keep in the fridge so make it ahead of time assuming you like.
01f84c7c-5df3-407f-87c6-056496ee8d65;EatingWell Member;1;Dr Bipeenchandra Bhamre answered, ‚ÄúBoth panic and heart attacks invite chest pain. When one has a heart attack the pain will spread to other areas like the arm, jaw, or neck but during a panic attack, the pain will only be felt in the chest. Heart attacks happen after physical exertion and panic attacks are seen after a stressful situation. You can get a heart attack after exercising but not a panic attack. If one is having chest pain or other symptoms and doesn‚Äôt have a history of panic attacks then it can indicate a heart attack. The panic attack will be there for some time and one will feel better but the symptoms of a heart attack may worsen and one will need immediate hospital admission. People having anxiety, depression or chronic stress may have chances of heart problems. A heart attack is a medical emergency and timely intervention is key to save the life of the patient

I made it last night for my family and set it up like a salad bar so everyone could make their own and choose their own ingredients. The dressing is very zesty, the 11-year-old gobbled the salad up. I used leftover chicken that I had in the fridge, which was so convenient. Next time I might try grilling the chicken for some extra flavor.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;EatingWell Member;4;I would eliminate the garlic next time...did not like what it did to the flavor of the dish. Could only find baby bellas and they tasted great. Would also increase the amount of fresh thyme leaves as I did not detect it in the dish.

c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;EatingWell Member;5;I used feta and cheddar as the cheeses. Doubled the Dijon and garlic. It was wonderful, flavourful and so easy to make. Thank you!

c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;EatingWell Member;5;We loaded our quiche with 8 cups of spinach and 8 ounces of fresh mixed mushrooms. More veggies mean more fiber and nutrients with less room for fat and calories coming from cream and eggs.2) We used a combination of whole milk and half-and-half instead of heavy cream in the custard. You get the same creamy results with less saturated fat.3) We went crustless! A crustless quiche is not only more streamlined but healthier too. Leaving the crust behind cuts down on calories, fat and carbohydrates leaving more room for the nutritious (and delicious) filling.Can I Use Frozen Spinach Instead of Fresh?Yes, you can! Frozen spinach is a good alternative to fresh as long as it is thawed and squeezed dry. Wet and watery ingredients will leave you with a wet and watery quiche, which is why we pre-cook the veggies before baking them in the custard. Be sure to squeeze dry or pre-cook any frozen or fresh veggies before adding them to the custard.How to Store Spinach & Mushroom QuicheQuiche can easily be made ahead of time or enjoyed as leftovers. To make Spinach & Mushroom Quiche ahead, cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Cover and reheat whole quiche at 350¬∞F for 30 to 45 minutes or microwave by the slice.Additional reporting by

Also subbed in 1/2 cup of parm and used only 1 cup of Gruy√®re.I didn‚Äôt have half and half, so just subbed in bit more milk. The dijon added some depth of flavor.

c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;Carolan O'Neill;5;Started making something similar to this several weeks ago. Just spinach, mushrooms, eggs and a bit of whatever cheese I had on hand. However I fell for the 'quinoa is good for you' mantra and added quinoa as a crust like base to make it seem more like a quiche. I bake for 25 to 30 minutes and then once cooled I cut in brownie size portions and store in the fridge. I have enough servings for a quick breakfast before work for a whole week. I usually add a splash of Choulala sauce for that added kick. It's quick to nuke in the microwave for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes and I have a proper, quick and nutritious breakfast. I don't add any milk to the eggs but I may experiment with some of the suggested seasonings.

c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;SuzyQ;5;This recipe is delicious. Tried the mini-quiche similar recipe made in muffin pan, but this was easier and less messy. Five stars!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;Kathy McClellan;5;Was delicious. When combining mushrooms and spinach mixture to eggs and milk, I added 1 1/2 T capers or to taste.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;monica desai;5;This was soooo good! I used baby portobello mushrooms and cooked until tiny. Very delicious.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;karen;5;Made it as directed and it was outstanding ! The best crustless quiche hands down!
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;bSTR1;1;I really wanted to like this recipe... I tried. I remained positive but my husband said... Hmmm, it's rubbery. Indeed it was. It was beautiful, smelled delicious, but the texture was very unappetizing. I followed the directions exactly. We each had a slice and then tossed the remainder.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;wellfam;5;Made this quiche for breakfast today. Went together so easily. My husband and I loved it. Will definitely be making again..
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;HEIDI;5;This is a spectacular recipe. I made it according to the recipe and it was gorgeous. I told my husband that this was going to become a staple in our household! The recipe is even more delightful, given its healthful ingredients and low calorie count.
c79ff18d-b499-4bfc-8840-9cf3f079cb1e;MeganOS;5;The combination of wild mushrooms and gruyere cheese really elevates the flavor of this quiche.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;3;The base of this is great. I'm so glad I read the comments though before I made it, as it needed a lot of doctoring to make it flavorful. After dinner, my somewhat picky 8 year old son asked me if he could take it for lunch to school (which Never happens). Here is what I added/changed:-Subbed fresh tomatoes with a can of petitie diced tomatoes with juice subbed kale with fresh chopped baby spinachAdded:- handful of diced fresh baby carrots-1 tbsp seasoning salt (one that has a paprika base)-1 tbsp Harissa-1/2 tsp ground coriander-1/2 tsp Better than Bouillon roasted beef flavor-1/2 tsp dried minced garlic-1/4 tsp black pepper-dash of cinnamonOnce served, my husband, son, and I all added Challula on top for a bit of spicy :)
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Makaylah H;4;I like it, I added different seasonings though. It‚Äôs a little dry, I wish it has some sauce or something
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Ariana Dee;4;I liked it! I did add a can of Rotel with diced green chilies to amp it up a bit, and I swapped in spinach for the kale, plus added celery salt.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;3;Bland, looks good. Has great ingredients just no flavour.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;I substituted gold potatoes to red potatoes and part boiled them before cooking just so I knew they would cook properly and also took note of using the extra seasoning which added a lot more flavour also part boiling reduces the cooking time for potatoes by 5 minutes
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;mrsnamarith;4;I love a one-pan meal! especially when it's NOT the usual pasta or rice. Instead of cooking everything in liquid, like most one pot meals, each component is saut√©ed, giving some nice browning. I knew we would not like that much cumin or poblano, so I used Italian seasoning instead, leaving out the poblano pepper. It's hearty and satisfying.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Nonna;5;We loved this recipe! My husband said he'd eat this every day!! I substituted spinach for the kale. I found the recipe a bit dry so I used a 14 oz can of petit diced tomatoes, including the juice.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;3;I appreciate the comments below they helped me make some changes before I fixed this. I added some Aleppo pepper to add some spice. My hubby liked it I thought it was ok. I served it with coleslaw and the little sweetness was a good compliment. I recommend turning the heat down to medium when you add the potatoes so they don't stick.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;c greco;5;I wanted to use up the ingredients this called for and was skeptical but this was delicious :) Used spinach instead of kale.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;I love it.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Alasini Sellesin;3;The recipe was okay. Kind of bland so I added more seasoning-garlic powder and onion powder-and dry. I feel like it‚Äôs missing a sauce to go with it and perhaps another starch such as a tortilla. Or probably an acidity note to help enhance it-so squeeze some lemon or lime at the end (I didn‚Äôt think about this because I was so hungry). Just some suggestions.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;3;The flavor was pretty good, but the dish is rather dry. I‚Äôm thinking through ways to spice up the leftovers a bit and bring some moisture to the dish.Similar to what someone said below, definitely cover the potatoes while caramelizing. I realized about halfway through that it wasn‚Äôt going to be nearly enough time and the potatoes weren‚Äôt cooked through.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;1;I cooked this and everything was great up until adding the potatoes to the skillet and they crusted so bad on my cast iron skillet I had to scrap the crust off with a spatula even after adding water and probably a 1/4 cup of olive oil. What am I doing wrong? It's a new cast iron skillet that is not supposed to require seasoning. Thanks for any help!
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;This one is definitely saved in my bookmarks! My husband loves this dish! I would say tho, I add a couple tbs of butter to the potatoes , plus paprika, garlic salt, and chilli powder. Other than that , it‚Äôs delicious! Oh and for some reason my potatoes have a hard time getting fully cooked so I add a bit of water after about 10 minutes of charring the potato and close it with a lid while stirring it occasionally!
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;I loved this recipe. Perfect meal.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Jess Coplans;5;This was very yummy! My husband added garlic salt to the potatoes and it all had nice flavors and textures. Sort of felt like breakfast for dinner-I wonder how it would be with scrambled eggs on top?
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;My family of five including 10, 13&15 year olds loves this dish. I added a generous amount of Montreal steak seasoning to the beef while cooking. And I used extra potatoes bc we needed to use them up AND added rosemary to the pan while they were cooking. Lastly, I added three time as much garlic as called for and yellow zucchini to the veggies pan fry.I think the additional seasoning/herbs/garlic helped create a full body flavor that others noted as missing in earlier reviews.Kids added some shredded cheese and sour cream and everyone had seconds. Thanks for this great recipe!
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;3;Made it and it‚Äôs okay. If I make it again, I‚Äôll add olives. We ate ours with sour cream which kinda kills the healthy eating part.Things to do differently:70:30on ground beef is okay. I used 80:20 and the potatoes soaked up that grease in a minute.Put a lid on the skillet when caramelizing the potatoes unless you want to add 20 minutes to your cooking time.Still tasty but not quite there.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Tammy;5;Couple extra steps that defeats quick weeknight meal, but worth it. Browned flat iron steak (on sale) instead of ground beef, remove from pan, tent & let rest before slicing thin strips. Keeping browned bits in pan, Saut√©ed peppers & onions, (did not add garlic yet) remove veggies from pan. Added 2 tsp oil to pan, saut√©ed sliced mushrooms & one cubed zucchini. Removed veggies from pan, added splash of olive oil, 1 TBS tomato paste w/2-3 tsp Italian seasoning, heat for approx 2 min on low heat stirring constantly. Stir in garlic approx 30 seconds, add 1/4 cup red wine. Reduce for approx 2-3 minutes stirring constantly then added all ingredients back to pan including juices from meat, salt & black pepper to taste, simmer on low stirring occasionally 5-10 minutes. Added fresh spinach the last couple minutes.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;MattS;3;Like several others, I thought the recipe is missing something. But it is hard to pin down what. I added sweet paprika. That helped. Then I added some Adobo powder. That helped a lot more. But, until I figure out what this really needs I am not likely to make it again.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;harini9624;5;Hi, this recipe looks so yummy and colourful. Thanks for the recipe.byhttps://www.hariniskitchen.com/
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Amie sawyer;5;Was so good! My whole family raved about it!! Added my own spin with a can of cream of mushrooms and topped with an egg. Also used some previous comments and added some Worcester sauce and balsamic vinegar. My only regret was I didn't make more!
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;EatingWell Member;5;Added potatoes and doubled the recipe passed the test in a house with six kids (ages 5-19) and two adults. All asked for seconds, thanks! Finally a healthy feel good recipe my family loves
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;Robin Naviasky Redding;4;This is good, and I'm always looking for a way to use kale. It just needs something--that unami taste? I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, but it still wasn't right. Then a splash of balsamic vinegar. That helped. I would make it again, but probably add some balsamic vinegar.
53488272-b1b2-4e33-a82c-6bbe5045e0ab;austindaily123;5;Tasted great, easily clean up, good protein intake. 10/10 I'll make it again.

cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;Thank you for showing me how to cook this healthier. This is one of my family's favorite meals.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;cheap and tasty. i would recommend keeping the pot covered even after adding the macaroni so the macaroni will be softer, that's what i did and it was nice.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Tim Risenhoover;5;Love this as written, but since this is the internet I did make a couple of modifications. These modifications were to lower the calories. First, used 90% lean bison meat. Then only one cup of whole wheat elbow macaroni. Also skipped the olive oil and just cooked the onion with the bison. I added a jalape√±o pepper and a bit of Tabasco and loved it.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;marisa;5;I wonder if anyone has added kidney, pinto, or cannelloni beans??
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Kristina;5;I been making this for years. It's my comfort food of choice. I use wheat elbows, low sodium broth, unsalted petite tomato and sauce, garlic, paprika, pepper, Italian seasoning, corn, onion, olive oil, and lean ground turkey. Dash of parmesan cheese.Someone suggested olives! I'm going to try adding that next. Maybe sub the corn. Either way, healthy and fulfilling
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Deanna Fortney;5;Stuck to this recipe almost completely and my family loved it. I did precook the noodles separately because I was concerned they would not cook and take all the liquid. They were al dente and I mixed them in and they came out great. This will be a regular go to as it was a quick meal to make
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;My wife and I loved it. The only change she made was she added half a jalape√±o pepper. We found the recipe makes closer to six of our servings.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;This is a great recipe that I've been making for years and even better the next day. The only thing I do differently is to add pitted black olives! Delicious!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;Love it! It is now on our dinner rotation. I do add the pasta along side the tomatoes so it is cooked more thoroughly.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;I didn't have diced tomatoes or broth. So I added diced cauliflower, more tomato sauce, water, garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder. It was so delicious and comforting.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;4;I tend to agree with the reviewer about cooking the pasta halfway before adding it. I followed the recipe (only doubled) and found the pasta somewhat chewy and not as soft as I would like. I simmered it for about five extra minutes without much change. Granted, the taste was good and the mix of spices was nice. I did use half paprika and half smoked paprika because I didn't have enough of the paprika. I also added some corn starch in a slurry to thicken it a bit. It made enough for my lunches this coming week which is great.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;3;If you follow the directions and put the raw pasta into the pot to cook, you will end up with an overcooked goulash with undercooked macaroni in it. Boil the pasta half of the way through before adding it to the pot.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;4;I'm going to try making with potato cubes instead of noodles to cut back on gluten.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;4;To the UK reader, tomato sauce is a canned product here in the US that is commonly used in saucy tomato-based dishes. It is cooked and pur√©ed tomatoes that have been sieved to a smooth, saucy consistency. It is thinner than American catsup and usually only contains salt as opposed to the spices, sweetener, and vinegar in catsup. You might be able to pur√©e tinned tomatoes and adjust the rest of the liquid as they would likely be a bit more watery or you could use a combination of tomato paste and broth or water to make up the quantity of liquid with similar results.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;judygoldin;3;I haven't made this yet but it looks delicious. Can you tell me what tomato sauce is in British English. To me it's ketchup? Could somebody answer me üôè please?
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Susan;4;My Mom made something similar growing up. I'm not sure where to make this comment, but I would love it if @eatingwell would add a 'notes' section to your recipes so we can make notes of any changes we make to the recipes. Thank you!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;5;The taste was very good. I did have to add almost 3 more cups of beef broth to allow the elbow mac to cook. I measured all listed ingredients exactly as instructed. Overall loved it.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;SoooooBored;5;It was a hit! I substituted crushed tomatoes for the other tomato ingredients.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;mschristine51;1;"My mother made ""American goulash "" for 60 years and I've made it the last 40 years also and it NEVER contains Italian seasoning. Unfortunately you have misrepresented this recipe. Savory ingredients are used in the American version of goulash NOT Italian."
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;dftaylor;5;So easy to make and was very tasty! I made a couple of minor changes - 1 tsp. paprika, no italian seasoning (not a fan), and added about 1/4 cup of ketchup (my mom always used ketchup when I was growing up). I love that you cook the noodles in the same pan. My husband and I both had two helpings!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;iamdatsechic;4;I followed this recipe to a T. Came out as expected but using the unsalted dice tomatoes and unsalted tomato sauce made it a bit bland. I might change it up by using Italian diced tomatoes and low sodium tomato sauce. The elbow macaroni works fine but maybe penne would be better otherwise a great recipe
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;pradeepmandgaonkar;5;I will definitely try it it looks sooo tasty üòã
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;pparker01967;5;I've been making this dish for 35 years and before that, eating my Mom's version. I have to say, this is pretty spot on. I like it. I don't like paprika though. So I will omit that. Just my taste.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Pamela Taylor;5;I‚Äôm making this as we speak . I like another poster use a whole can of tomato sauce. I‚Äôm going to use rotini pasta cooked separately instead of elbow because sauce adheres to it better. Smells delicious.Fresh basil for a garnish is very tasty with tomato recipes.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;lv2cook4;5;This meal was easy to make and a hit with the family! I used penne and it could have cooked longer and use more broth. Other than that, will make again!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;candyo;5;Thank you! This is it. Tastes exactly like the Goulash my mom made when I was a kid. Unfortunately, she couldn‚Äôt even remember the dish she made and that my sisters and I loved. Only change I made was to use a 14 oz can of tomato sauce as I always want to use an entire open can of just about anything. My girls loved it, too. I can‚Äôt wait to make it again!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;yumfood;5;Easy family meal. Used Rotel tomatoes. Kids loved it. A high end hamburger helper.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Kelly;5;Didn't make any changes. But used half Hungarian sharp and Hungarian sweet paprika. Really tasty and easy to make. I love one pot meals. Will definitely make again.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Lhinestx;5;This is a frequent family dinner. It‚Äôs easy and healthy. I use ground chicken. Very nourishing and the whole family likes.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Leavis;5;Delicious recipe. My innovations included penne pasta made from millet to add protein and ground chicken instead of ground beef. Also ditched the salt. An easy substitution for Italian seasoning - 1 tsp each dried thyme, oregano, basil leaves. And lastly I added some crushed red pepper.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Migizi;5;In New England we called it American Chop Suey
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Cherry Albino Peters;5;I did not make any changes. It's tasty
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Kris;4;It's a good recipe but I'd never call it goulash. That's something else entirely, according to my German grandmother. This is what we called a homemade version of hamburger helper and we had it a lot and loved it.
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;EatingWell Member;4;Whole family ate it & super easy!
cefa2dea-fa7f-495e-82a1-715fdd5163b3;Willa Burney;4;This recipe turned out well for me. I used the fire-roasted diced tomatoes for a bit of extra flavor, and white pepper instead of black, as that is my preference. It did have kind of a sweet flavor to it, and I would have liked it to be more savory. Looking at the ingredients, I'm not sure how that came to be. Overall, a hearty, satisfying dish.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;girlofthewest;4;This was a decent recipe. Here's how I would improve it though:1) Cook it a little longer, simmer for another 30 minutes to get those flavors mixing.2) Add 16 drops Melinda xxxtra hot habenero sauce to the pot.3) If your not cooking this as a vegan dish, fry up a couple sunny side eggs in a quick spray of oil and top them in the bowls before serving they add protein and a bit of richness to the dish to thicken it up a bit.Otherwise, pretty good.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;5;Just the way we love our chili (spices) and the swt. pots. are a healthful, delicious addition!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;IMLADYRED;5;I like sweet potatoes with lots of calories (butter, brown sugar, honey, etc.) so I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd like them mixed with all the savory/spicy ingredients. But I was very, very surprised at how fantastic everything came together. I‚Äôm not vegan, but at least once in a while, I will be!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;5;This was delicious! Plenty for two people with enough leftover for another night. Served with light sour cream, avocado and shredded cheddar, with corn bread on the side. It‚Äôs going into regular rotation,
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Michelle Burton;5;I made this chili today. I wanted that fire-roasted taste, but was out of fire-roasted tomatoes, so I added a tablespoon of fire-roasted fajita cooking and seasoning blend by Spice World. Delicious!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Sue Kohlert;5;We had a chili cook-off at work. I made a traditional chili but wanted to make something for my vegan coworkers and chose this. I hadn't planned to enter it in the contest but did on a whim - why not? Guess what? It won!!! I highly recommend this. You won't even miss the meat!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;DesertCat76;4;It was delicious and super-easy to make. We used frozen sweet potatoes and those tasted great. The only problem was that I accidentally put 4 tbsp chili powder in there. Eeek! My mouth is on fire and we ate 30+ min ago. Just watch your measurements and you'll be fine. Enjoy!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;erickd;5;This is an absolutely delicious chili recipe. I found it while looking for recipes my vegetarian daughter would enjoy, and it became a huge hit for the whole family. We now make it at least once a month.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;5;I made this last night. Used chicken broth instead of water‚Ä¶water didn‚Äôt seem quite right. Also did not have chipotles but was flavorful enough. Will add it next time for more heat. Delicious. Served with shredded Mexican cheese and yogurt. I will definitely make this again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;wls26ce95876ef4;5;I made this for a soup party and everyone asked for the recipe
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;casardinhayahoocom;5;Probably the best tasting vegetarian chili I have made! I used one can of black beans and one can of pinto beans to use up what I had. It seemed a little watery at the end, but solved that using an old trick I learned from another cookbook way back: use a fork or slotted spoon and mash up some of the beans against the side of the pot, and mix in. This adds enough starch back into the water so you don't have to add any other thickener. I love ground chipotle. If you can't get ground chipotle, you can add some chipotle hot sauce which is often found in the Latin/Mexican sections of grocery stores, or use Cholula or Tabasco brand chipotle hot sauce.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;lindsayban;5;This was pretty delicious. I did though change things to the way my family likes their chilli. I didnt use chipolte peppers since one I didn't have any and two not a huge fan. I subbed it for smoked and regular paprika. I also used rotel instead of canned tomatoes and a small tomato paste. I added in kidney beans and butter beans for more protein why not. I roasted my sweet potato before with thinly sliced onion that i then added at the end so it would retain its shape. added some cinnamon. but all in all its a great base. like another reviewer said they mashed the beans ever so slightly to get that thicker texture. all in all will have this again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;rangerskadi;5;Very tasty. I added a fresh jalape√±o and used a bit more than 1/2 a tin of chipotle peppers and about 500g of minced pork which I browned with the onions / jalape√±o. One can of black beans- that‚Äôs all I had - was just the right amount for me. Delicious, nutritious and satisfying meal! I‚Äôm very happy I decided to try this out.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Mandy Hollis Reyes;5;Added ground turkey. Yummy!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;igster101;5;So so good and so easy to make. I am not a fan of meatless or vegetarian. This changed my mind.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;ExperimentingCook;5;This one's a staple at our house - LOVE it! I always make a quadruple batch so there's plenty to freeze for future meals. We can't do spicy so I have to leave out the chipotle but I do add 2 tsp of *smoked* paprika (not the regular kind) to my quad batch to make up for it. My husband prefers meat in his chili so I brown a pkg of ground turkey in a quad batch. At a friend's suggestion, I also add pumpkin (4 c. for a quad batch 1 c. for a single batch). It does wonders for the consistency and it blends perfectly with the sweet potato so you don't even notice it. (I always let it simmer for at least a couple of hours, usually more.) I've made this for a potluck vegetarian and vegan friends would be attending (w/out the meat, of course). Even the meat-eaters loved it. I've shared the recipe with lots of other people and am taking a batch to friends tonight who just brought home a new baby.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Theresa;5;I love love love this recipe. This is my 5th time making it. For the most part I stick to the receipe and really enjoy it. Tonight I added ground turkey. Cooked it separate in a pan and then added it when you add the beans and tomatoes. I use the fire roasted tomatoes. Very wholesome, great for a cold night, a football game.. try it, you‚Äôll like it.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;John Artise;5;My girlfriend and I just tried this recipe tonight. This is by far one of the most spectacular chili‚Äôs we've had in a very long time. The combination of all these delectable, and perfectly balanced flavors totally blew our minds! It has been officially added to our personal recipe list! Thank you so much for conjuring up such culinary magic!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Elizabeth;5;Excellent recipe for people who eat low calorie but want all the flavor! I did not have Chipotle but I did have a can of Bush's black bean fiesta which is in mild chipotle sauce and I also added a jalapeno to give it a little bit more spice and some corn during the time the tomatoes were added to the recipe.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Jenna Engelhardt;5;This was incredible! I told everyone the recipe. I used 3 sweet potatoes & used cayenne pepper (a dash) instead of the pepper specified.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Katherine Rickard;5;This is one of the best chili's I have ever made. The flavors are fantastic and it makes a nice thick cold weather soup. You do not actually need the dutch oven, I do not have one and just used a regular pot.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Diane Bolton;5;Made it for church Potluck, got 1st place award. I would like to add cooked lentils in the chilli but not too sure what you suggest for the measurment of lentils and probably recommend to mix it at the end. Please let me know what you suggest. Thank you so much for all you yummy healthy recipes. Love it
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Vicky Bruhn;5;I loved loved loved it! I made no changes. It tasted amazing!!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;nmchilecat;5;Wow! For a meatless chili, this was surprisingly good! I used homemade chicken stock instead of water also, I used 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce instead of the dried. I don't know about the 4 servings thing...it made 6-8 servings. I served it with Vinegary Cole Slaw from this site, and homemade cornbread muffins. So good! Will definitely make again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Maggie Clinton;4;Oh my word!!! Amazing. I added a full 28oz can of diced tomatoes and used about half the water. Also added about 1tbsp of smoked paprika and 2 chipotle peppers in adobe sauce which gave it a really smoky kick. It could probably serve 5. I only gave it 4 stars because I think the add ons made it 5 star.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Leslie;5;I just made a quadrupled this recipe (with some slight variations because of what I had) and it is fabulous. There are not many recipes that work out so well when upping the quantity! 1) I used dried black beans that I soaked the day before - I tend to think they taste much better than canned and are paraben free. 2) I used cumin seeds because I didn't have ground, and 3) I used a spicy Hungarian paprika that I had in the house instead of Chipotle.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Jessica;5;Turned out delicious, quite spicier than I thought so I'm glad I didn't add any green chili as planned! Served with rice and my boyfriend loved it. Served leftovers with shrimp added! Definitely will be making this again!

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;DG87;5;This has become a lunch staple for my fiance during the winters. We make a big batch and it stays delicious throughout the week.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Jennifer;5;One of our go to recipes. We chop up a chipotle from a can instead of using the powder. I think it gives it more smokiness than the powder. We double this every time we make it.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Jill Weigner Long;5;Quick, easy, and delicious. I used rotel instead of plain tomatoes and added a pinch of cinnamon per other reviews. Will make again!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;slyist1;5;My new favorite chili! I substituted the regular chili with hot mexican style chili powderr , it adds a nice kick. But great with regular chili also. I also thickened my chili with a little tomato paste. Its a winning recipe for sure. One of my favorite go tos in the winter.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Kyle Lauren Scott Bouknight;5;I will definitely make this vegetarian chili again...it's simple to make and very delicious. The ingredients are also easy to locate at the supermarket...and very affordable. We did not miss the ground turkey or Italian sausage that I normally put in my chili. I added a bit of cinnamon (after reading one of the reviews) and my, oh my...what a delicious pot of chili! Cole slaw was the side salad, along with a thin slice of whole wheat toasted French bread.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Christy Young;5;This will be on our list to make again. It was full of flavor, filling, and comforting. My husband prefers meat but he took seconds of this dish. I appreciated that it was not hard to make.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Cindy Diamond;4;I put in one can of beans (no tomatoes yet) and pureed a portion of the mixture. This created a creamy base. Then, I added the 2nd can of beans, the tomatoes and a can of all natural pumpkin puree. In the spice mixture, I included 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. This creates a earthy and slightly sweet offset to the smoky flavors. Really tasty!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;christino;4;I used all the ingredients called for in the recipe. The only thing I did differently was cooked the onions and then added everything else in and let it all cook until done. Doubled the recipe, glad I did for next days dinner. Yes, we will make this again.
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Lucy M. Casale;5;This is my favorite chili recipe! I add an extra can of beans and jalape√±o peppers :)
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Marnechia;5;Looooove this. I used crushed tomatoes and lemon juice. No Chipotle so used hot pepper seasoning. Tastes like chili!!

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Melburta;5;I added cooked quinoa at the end to make this a bit more substantial (and half the amount of chilli powder). This is so tasty and easy! Will definitely become a staple in our house!
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Sophie;4;ITS A KEEPER This was a super easy recipe which we all loved. Made it for meatless Monday and saved enough for Meatless Wednesday. Very tasty over rice. I imagine it could be made into a faux sloppy Joe recipe with bread or a soup by adding broth or water. It's a keeper for us. Pros: Super easy, tasty, meatless, serve over rice, pasta Cons: Nothing
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;4;Sweet, spicy, and tangy This is my favorite chili. The first time, I made it exactly according to the recipe. Since then, I sometimes alter the hotness depending on who I'm cooking for, but otherwise, I don't make any changes. It has a multitude of flavors: sweet sweet potatoes and tomatoes, tangy lime and cilantro, spicy chili powder, smoky chipotle, and earthy black beans. I haven't met anyone yet who didn't like it, although I did have a few who said, It's not chili, but it's good! (One caveat: My social group are pretty adventurous eaters. They include people who cook medieval recipes like spicy pork and currant pies, so they had experienced and learned to enjoy flavor combinations that are quite unusual in some modern cuisines.) Pros: Great variety of flavors Cons: Might stretch your tastes
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;4;I used two canned chipotle peppers instead of the ground chipotle. The flavor really complemented the sweet potato. Served over bulgur wheat, this was a tasty and satisfying supper.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;Amy Raines;4;First time I made this dish, I followed the recipe as written and found it to be good, but a bit mushy, due to all of the black beans. It was good, but I just didn't love the texture. Second time, I replaced the black beans with cans of organic mixed beans (black, kidney, and pinto) and found it to be much better.

Pros: Easy,vegetarian,fiber
d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;EatingWell Member;5;Awesome I didn't have the chipotle chili pepper so i used red cayenne pepper instead and I still achieved that great heat I was hoping for. Excellent dish, will definitely make it again.

d49f02e7-a886-4a8c-b92d-75a85188f92e;NJhousewife;5;Excellent I added a large clove of garlic and a carrot, both chopped, and a chopped poblano chili which i happened to have on hand, as well as a tablespoon of cocoa.

It wasn't nearly spicy enough for me, and the sweetness of the sweet potato overpowered it. The second time I made it, I got chipotle powder and it made a huge difference. I still add a little extra dark chili powder and cayenne pepper because I like spicy chili. I also use/cooked beans that I prepare the night before. Cooking down the sweet potatoes a little thickens it and makes the consistency of the chili closer to meat chili, which I like.

I usually follow recipes more as a guideline but since this is my first Eating Well recipe and I knew I'd be reviewing I tried to follow it as closely as possible. I wound up accidentally using the whole 28 oz can of diced tomatoes so I added an extra sweet potato. There is so much spice in this recipe I didn't add any extra. Also, I did not have ground chipotle pepper to hand so I used chipotle hot sauce instead. I used the juice from a whole lime which amounted to more than 4 teaspoons but my husband loved that flavor and actually squeezed in the extra wedge of lime I served it with. Also, I wound up chopping more like 3/4 cup cilantro since I LOVE cilantro--especially with lime. I will definitely make this again. My daughter says 'too much cilantro' (but like I said, I added extra) and my husband says 'it was really good'. I served it with extra lime wedges, a dollop of sour cream, corn bread, and a bottle of inexpensive Reisling (Black Swan) which was suprisingly tasty.

I think it's spot on, but I also used extra sweet potato which might have balanced it. When I make mine, I use only 2 cups water, and don't rinse the black beans (also get the reduced sodium). This helps create a thicker chili. I also like to slow cook this over a few hours. It really binds the flavors. Also... being in Texas, I needed a little more heat, so I add between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.Pros: Flavorful, aromatic, low calorieCons: None

As it was, this was still a little over my hotness threshold, and I'm not a wimp. Other than that, the chili had a very good taste and is easy to make. Pros: Good taste Cons: Way too spicy!

It is my go-to drink when I need a refresher. I use equal amounts of frozen strawberries and and orange juice and throw in a bog blob of Greek Yogurt. When berries are not sweet enough a few drops of honey will help, or substitute Tropics, Orange, Strawberry Bannana juice for the Orange Juice.

12b3e746-d018-4749-88e4-dc8cda99f3f6;Shalena Ali;3;I used fresh squeezed orange juice, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries. Came out good and tasted good too. However, it was not very filling. Was still hungry after.

I use orange juice and mixed berries to make mine. I have NO idea why the carbs count is so high. I plugged the listed stats into my Weight Watchers online and it said 9 points. I freaked out and plugged each item in manually and it came down to 3. Don't go by these nutrition facts, I think they might be way wrong. Pros: Taste, filling, quick, versatile
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;abbyz2000;4;I tried to chop the mushrooms so small my mushroom-hater wouldn't see them but I didn't do a good enough job. Next time they'll go in the food processor. The taste is pretty good. Definitely needed the cheese to jazz it up. I ate it without the cheese because I'm on WW and it was a little bland. I also had to add about 6oz more water than the recipe called for and I hadn't even put in 8oz of pasta. I used 5 oz, which was the perfect amount. I don't like pasta to be the majority ingredient in any dish, just personal preference.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;William Russell;5;I didn't have any mushrooms but we didn't miss them too much and I added diced green peppers and chopped garlic. We enjoyed it as it was quite tasty.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;EatingWell Member;5;My husband and I both Loved it. He does not like mushrooms he never knew they were in there. Worked out great for me. Enjoyed every bite.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;linda;5;Delish! Family loved it. I did not do mushrooms but carrots instead & added a little brown sugar & a bit more water. This will be a keeper because it‚Äôs fast & easy too. I made broccoli on the side.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;EatingWell Member;4;I use mozzarela instead of cheddar. Is the pasta referring to dry pasta or cooked pasta in the receipe?

c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;TechieMom;5;LOVE this one-pan recipe! I have made this several times and this is how I make it my own: 1) 1/2 ground beef and ground turkey. I pre-brown and freeze my ground meat for convenience 2) Very finely chopped carrots (i.e. food processor) instead of/in addition to mushrooms. 3) Substituted low sodium beef stock for water. Since my ground meat is strained and I'm not using mushrooms I increase liquid to 1 1/2 cup and may add more during cooking if it seems dry. 3) Substituted 1Tbl Montreal Steak Seasoning for Italian Seasoning/Garlic/Salt. Really gave it a good flavor. I serve with broccoli (finely chop, microwave with about 1 Tbl water loosely covered for 2-4 minutes), and my family mixes it in. Great weeknight meal with easy clean-up.
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;Stephy0682;3;This recipe was okay. I am only giving it 3 stars because it was just okay. Me and my younger two kids didn't care for the wheat pasta (we used barilla). I will try it again but with my own tweaks. My 4 and 8 year old didn't like it. My husband enjoyed it and so did my 12 year old. I really think it was the wheat pasta. I usually use Barilla Veggie pasta noodles in all of my pasta dishes. I think next time I will use that instead of wheat and I will swap out the Sharp Cheddar Cheese for Mozzarella or Fresh Grated Parm cheese. Overall I made the dish exactly as written the only minor tweak was that I omitted mushrooms. We are not fans of it. But I think if you put your own tweaks you can definitely spruce it up a bit
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;Nom & Seek;5;Loved this. Added two cans of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce + 1/2 cup of dry white wine. Yummy!
c555aa60-160b-4581-8b8b-2672234d30a3;Jake Mehring;5;Added red and green peppers along with the onion and mushrooms and threw everything in the food processor to chop it up real good. It hides all the veggies and adds some great flavor. The whole family loves it!

4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;EatingWell Member;5;Delicious, healthy, and easy to make! I made a few subs, but only because of family preferences. I used tricolor quinoa instead of rice, rice vinegar instead of mirin, and pickled onions instead of kimchi. Will def make again!

4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;kehillmd;5;This was a great meal. I made some substitutions, though. First, I don‚Äôt like kimchi, so I pan grilled some zucchini and skipped the cucumber too. I subbed cauliflower rice which I put in the wok with onions. I roasted some sweet potatoes and added everything bagel seasoning to the salmon. I thought the Tamar/mirin/ginger sauce needed some extra flavor so I added coconut aminos. I kept the avocado and the sriracha mayo. I crunched up the nori on top. Fantastic
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;EatingWell Member;1;Q I cannot find how to use the nori sheets.
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;Cooking_Gal;5;Fabulous! I have made it with fresh Salmon and also with Canned Salmon and love it either way! Such great flavor as all the textures and seasonings just work together wonderfully!

4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;ninarae2011gmailcom;5;Fabulous! We loved this recipe. So tasty. Will definitely make it again. We didn't have any kimchi, so made up a quick batch of pickled red cabbage and it worked just as well.
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;ArianeK;5;We loved this! We eat a lot of Asian dishes so we had all the ingredients on hand. Only changes were to add spicy fermented radish and ginger carrots to the toppings, plus Ochazuke Nori packets instead of regular nori. The mirin-tamari sauce was especially good.
4c30f6ec-c12a-46ac-b142-9137e4fed007;EatingWell Member;5;We have enjoyed poke in the past, and this looked great. We made it and it was soo easy! Also, much cheaper than eating out. This was a great option for at home!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;3;It tasted fine but there is no way this recipe is 325 calories. I put the ingredients into MyFitnessPal and it was 450 calories. And that was with thin-sliced whole grain bread that was 70 calories a slice. With a heartier bread, this sandwich could easily be over 600 calories. If I try this again, I‚Äôll definitely use less hummus and guacamole to get the calories and the mess down. This was a very, very messy sandwich.

1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;3;I love the idea of this, but I don't digest raw veggies very well. Plus I don't even like the main ones suggested to use (bell pepper, cucumber) so I'd love to have some other ideas of how to make it. I'm thinking maybe yellow squash, radishes, and tomatoes.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;5;Husband loved it. I thought the whole grain bread was too sweet and will switch brands. Will try flavored cream cheese, too.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Judie;5;Love this recipe and make it frequently. I add a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a few shakes of hot sauce. Also, I usually toast the bread.

1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;5;I really enjoy this. I‚Äôve made it many times now. It has become a regular lunch. I add a variety or veggies. Something pickled takes it to the next level. Add either pickles or olives. Yummy!!!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;5;I love making this in an Ole or low carb wrap! Sometimes I add a slice of swiss cheese.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Tumbarella;5;To switch it up instead of using mixed greens I‚Äôll substitute with alfalfa sprouts or micro greens and sprinkle with some feta cheese. So delicious!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;EatingWell Member;1;"Your so-called ""diabetic"" recipes are obviously for type 1 diabetics (where they inject insulin according to the amount of carbs they eat), as they are COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE for type 2 diabetics. 39g of carbs in one meal? I can't even have that many carbs in one day. It would spike my blood sugar to dangerous levels. I wonder how many type 2 diabetics have tried your recipes and wondered why they are getting sicker. Perhaps you should rethink and research before you claim your recipes are diabetic-friendly."

1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Liz;5;This was really good, I sliced up mini sweet peppers and used those. Next time I might add some Everything seasoning or Crushed Red Pepper. ??
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Laura H;5;Was not expecting this to taste so good! It‚Äôs a simple sandwich but even with no added seasonings, it‚Äôs delicious. I‚Äôm flexitarian, but love that it‚Äôs vegan. I used only 2 tbsp of hummus, and I recommend using quality local bread, if possible.
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Ron Hebert;5;Amazing Sandwich. I've been wanting it again, since Monday. So tasty and filling!
1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;Patricia Baughman;5;Delicious and easy. I used organic multigrain sandwich bread from Whole Foods, and filled with salad, grated carrots and black olives.

1619f6bd-936e-4a47-af34-e8ba65aaa4df;joyc21;5;This sandwich was a hit and so easy to make using whatever you have on hand. I used just 2 tbsp. of hummus and loaded up on the veggies. I also used red and green bell pepper and roasted them in the oven along with some onions. This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and I didn't miss the meat.

The rest is just low calorie vegetables. A yummy and filling lunch.
