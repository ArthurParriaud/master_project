I thought it would take to long to cook in the oven, this killing the chicken but I only needed to add five minutes and another 1/2 cup of chix stock and it was amazing. I did squeeze a couple of fresh lemon wedges over the final product with the fresh parsley and I think that upped the flavor profile in a good way. This is a great recipe and it's going into our monthly rotation, especially during the winter months in upstate NY. Thank you for posting this recipe!

b4eaada5-2d44-4661-9b12-fe04b0fe7b55;penelopewall;5;This dish was really great and satisfying for a vegetarian main. I misread the ingredients and made with toasted sesame oil, which had a strong flavor stacked up with the cider. Will definitely make again with regular sesame oil. My carrots were kind of big and old (not the tender carrots you find with tops on). I found I had to cook for 10 minutes more than suggested for them to get tender enough. I also had more than a pound on the sheet-pan, so that probably added to cook time, but still came out great. Tip: if you have leftovers, store the sauce and carrots separately. The sauce curdled for me when I reheated in the microwave.

0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;n2deewind;5;We enjoyed this as a main dish light dinner. I admit to grating a teaspoon or 2 of ginger in, being VERY liberal with garlic, adding sriracha and using more lime juice and less oil, but I thought this was a fantastic base recipe.It’s the right kind of crunchy and very refreshing with the lime juice base. I used half of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. Will make again.
0be0ad82-ac03-41fe-a8cf-efe8f678d7cc;abbyz2000;3;This was okay but I won't make it again. It made 6 servings, not 4. I didn't have any mint, so maybe it would have been better with it.
